# Rgbmcmr
A code for Bayesian inference of distance to galaxies with resolved RGBs

For more details, see Tollerud et al. 2016 (ApJ, in press).

Depends on [emceemr](https://github.com/eteq/emceemr), which is included here as a submodule.  For convenience there's a symbolic link to the actual emceemr code directory. (Although I'm not really sure if that is very cross-platform or dependent on the version of git or whatever.)
